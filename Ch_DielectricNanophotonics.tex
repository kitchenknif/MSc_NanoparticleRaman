\section{Dielectric Nanophotonics}
\label{ch:DielectricNanophotoics}

    \subsection{Crystalline silicon as the material of choice for Dielectric Nanophotonics}
            Crystalline silicon has been almost ubiquitously chosen as the material of choice for dielectric nanophotonics.
        There are several reasons for this. First, the material parameters are suitable for visible and infrared nanophotonic devices~---
        Crystalline silicon has a high refractive index, $n \approx 3.5$ at visible and IR wavelengths\cite{li1980refractive}, giving high contrast
        with air, and therefore good field confinement for resonant particles at those wavelengths\cite{mie1908beitrage, dmitriev2016resonant}. Also
        a very important fact, distinguishing crystalline silicon from amorphous silicon, is the near-zero absorbtion at visible wavelengths, meaning
        that crystalline silicon nanoparticles are nearly lossess at visible and IR wavelengths, making any potential nanophotonic devices very
        efficient and not prone to thermal dissipation~--- something that plagues their plasmonic counterparts.
            Silicon, being the basis of almost all modern electronics, can easliy boast a highly developed ecosystem of fabrication and processing
        technologies, making it very easy (if expensive) to fabricate almost any required structure.
            \hlr{Last, but not least, silicon is a bio-compatible material, meaning it is easy to design nanophotnoic devices for medical applications.}

            Another interesting application dimension is related to the existence of and intristic Raman response in crystalline silicon. Raman
        scattering of light, and inelastic scattering phenomenon, is an important electromagnetic effect\cite{hayes2012scattering} that has a large number of applications:
        sensing\cite{moskovits1985surface}, optical amplification\cite{islam2004wideband}, lasing\cite{pask2003design}.
        Traditionally, enhancement of Raman scattering for SERS applications has been mostly delegated to metallic nanoparticles, but
        recent studies of high-index subwavelength nanoparticles have paved the way for all-dielectric resonant nanophotonic devices, including
        the possibility of enhancing Raman scattering, including intristic Raman from the nanoparticles.

    \subsection{Analytical Models}
        \subsubsection{Mie-type resonances of dielectric nanoparticles}
                An important problem for dieletric nanophotnoics is the scattering of eletromagnetic radiation by
            a homogeneous sphere. This problem has an analyticial solution, generally called Mie theory\cite{mie1908beitrage}.
            The solution of this problem utilizes the symmetry of the problem, and decomposes the scattered radiation into
            vector spherical harmonics. The result is a set of coeffeicients, $a_i, b_i$ describing the relative contributions
            of $a_i$, electric multipole resonances and $b_i$, magnetic multipole resonances into the final scattered field.

                Based on this, one can easily estimate the extinction, scattering and absorbtion cross-sections (for a detailed
                derivation, see Appendix \ref{ap:Mie}):

            \begin{align}
                C_{sca} &= \frac{2\pi}{k^2_m}\sum_{l=1}^\infty (2l +1)(|a_l|^2 + |b_l|^2)\\
                C_{ext} &= \frac{2\pi}{k^2_m}\Re\sum_{l=1}^\infty (2l +1)(a_l + b_l)\\
                C_{abs} &= C_{ext} - C_{sca}
            \end{align}

                The main limitation of the Mie solutions is their reliance on the symmetry of the scatterer~--- the solution can
            be generalized to layered spheres, layered  infinite cyllinders, but scatterers lacking symmetry cannot be accurately described
            by Mie-type solutions. In those cases, T-Matrix methods can be used, but they are outside the scope of this thesis.

        \subsubsection{Raman scattering from crystalline materials}
                Raman scattering of light from crystalline materials is inealstic scattering resulting from the interaction of optical phonons with
            the incident light. Raman scattering is a versatile method of probing the phonon stucture of the materials.
            A simplisitc classical model of Raman scattering is sufficient to demonstarte the effect and to properly predict many of the
            Raman scattering peaks of semiconductors\cite{peter2010fundamentals}. In the model, interaction between light and phonons
            is represented as a perturbation of the electric susceptibility $\chi$:

            \begin{align}
                \chi(\vec{k}_i, \omega_i, \vec{Q}) = \chi_0(\vec{k}_i, \omega_i) + \frac{\partial\chi}{\partial\vec{Q}}_0\vec{Q}(\vec{r},t) + ...
            \end{align}

            Where $Q$ represents the displacement of atoms in the lattice by phonons.
            Then the induced polarization by the incident light, perturbed by the phonons can be written as

            \begin{align}
                \vec{P}_{ind}(\vec{r}, t, \vec{Q}) &= \frac{\partial\chi}{\partial\vec{Q}_0}\vec{Q}(\vec{r},t)
                                                        \vec{F}_i(\vec{k}_i, \omega_i)\cos(\vec{k}_i\cdot\vec{r}-\omega_i t)
            \end{align}
            which contains both Stokes and anti-Stokes shifted components. The intensity of the Raman scattered light
            is dependant on the polarization of the incident light and the phonon structure of the material. All of this
            information can be condensed into a second rank Raman tensor:

            \begin{align}
                \hat{R} &= \frac{\partial\chi}{\partial\vec{Q}}\vec{Q}_n \\
                I_s &\propto | \vec{e}_i \cdot \hat{R} \cdot\vec{e}_s|^2
            \end{align}

            A more detailed derviation can be found in Appendix \ref{ap:Raman}.

    \subsection{Numerical Models}
            Since scattering from arbitrarily-shaped particles cannot be analytically described, use of numerical modelling methods
        is required to model these particles. A large number of numerical methods exist that can be used for these purposes.

        \subsubsection{\hlb{Discrete Dipole Approximation}}
            The discrete dipole approximation is a method of numerically simulating light scattering from arbitrarily shaped particles.
            The general idea of the method is to replace an arbirtarily shaped scatterer by a set of point dipoles and calculate the
            scattering by each dipole on its one plus the interaction between the dipoles. This makes calculations straightforward
            for scatterers of arbitrary geometries and compositions.

    \subsection{\hlb{Fabrication of Dielectric Nanoparticles}}
            There are several techniques to fabricate dielectric nanoparticles. They can be ordered in terms of level of control over the size
        of the particles and the options of building patterned nanostructures for the nanoparticles. Complexity and cost of the processes generally
        correlate with the level of control provided by the different techniques.
            The main techniques can be grouped into: chemical synthesis\cite{shi2012new}, thin-film dewetting\cite{abbarchi2014wafer},
        laser ablation-based\cite{zywietz2014laser} and lithographic methods.

        \subsubsection{\hlb{Chemical synthesis}}
                Chemical vapor deposition of silicon from disilane gas has been used to fabricate silicon nanoparticles, ($Si_2H_6 \rightarrow 2Si + 3H_2$ at
            high temperatures) achieving polycrystalline spherical particles\cite{shi2012new}. Monodisperse colloidal particles have been fabricated from trisilane ($Si_3H_8$)
            at high temperature in n-Hexane\cite{shi2013monodisperse}. Sizes of the particles were controlled by changing the concentration of the trisilane and the temperature of the
            reaction. The main disadvantages of these types of methods are the porosity and high hydrogen concentration of the particles and necessity of
            further processing if ordered nanostructures are required.

        \subsubsection{\hlb{Thin-film dewetting}}
                Thermal dewetting of thin films can be used to create arrays of nanoparticles, with size and phase controlled by the thickness of the intial
            film and temperature of the process\cite{abbarchi2014wafer}. If fabricated from an unpatterned film, the particles will be unordered~--- producing ordered particles is this
            way requires an additional patterning of the the film, usually by lithographic processes, which increases the complexity of the process and the cost.

        \subsubsection{\hlb{Laser ablation-based methods}}
                Laser ablation by focused ultra-short pulses can also be used to fabricated nanoparticles by heating up the irradiated area to eject material into
            spherical particles deposited either near the irradiated area\cite{kuznetsov2012magnetic} or transferred to another substrate\cite{zywietz2014laser}. Control of the beam sport, fluency and donor material
            structure and be used to control individual particle size and the number of particles fabricated from a single pulse (down to one particle in best-case
            scenario). The ultra-short pulses can also be used to change the phase of already fabricated structures by means of light-induced thermal annealing.

                The shortcomings of the current methods are that they often require additional annealing to crystallize the fabricated nanoparticles and that
            method presented in \cite{zywietz2014laser} is limited to transferring nanoparticles to transparent substrates.

        \subsubsection{\hlb{Lithographic methods}}
                Using electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching, one can pattern substrates with high-quality nanocylinders, with near-perfect
            control of both size and positioning of the structures\cite{bakker2015magnetic}. This give great flexibility in terms of fabricating ordered nanostructures, but at the
            cost of extreme complexity and high costs.

    \subsection{Experimental Characteriztion Methods}
        \subsubsection{Electron Microscopy}
            \label{sec:ElectronMicroscopy}
                    The geometrical parameters of the fabricated particles were measured by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
                Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).
