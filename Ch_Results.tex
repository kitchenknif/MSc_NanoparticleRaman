\section*{Results}
    The main results of the project are:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Developed two methods for single-stage fabrication of crystalline silicon nanoparticles using femto-second laser ablation:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Direct laser writing of arrays of nanoparticles in an amorphous silicon thin-film
                \item Forward laser transfer of crystalline nanoparticles from amorphous silicon thing-films to arbitrary substrates
            \end{itemize}
        \item Demonstrated crystallinity of nanoparticles by electron diffraction and Raman measurements
        \item Implemented DDA modeling of apsherical nanoparticles, compared shape-dependent shifts of resonances to pure Mie-theory
            and FIT modeling
        \item Measured elastic scattering spectra from single nanoparticles in dark-field configuration
        \item Estimated sizes of nanoparticles based on positions of Mie-type resonances
        \item Measured Raman scattering intensity from crystalline nanoparticles
        \item Demonstrated resonant behavior of Raman signal intensity dependent on relative positions of excitation wavelength and Mie-type resonances
            of the nanoparticles
    \end{enumerate}

    % As a result of this project, it has been theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated, that Raman scattering
    % from crystalline silicon nanoparticles can be enhanced by the Mie-type modes of the nanoparticles, provided that the
    % spectral positions of the resonances corresponds to the excitation wavelength. The strongest enhancement has been shown
    % to be from magnetic resonances, because of the field confinement inside the particle and the Q factor of the resonance.
    % We have demonstrated an $140$-fold increase in Raman scattering from resonant particles, enhanced on the magnetic dipole
    % resonance.
    %
    % As part of the project, two methods of fabricating crystalline nanoparticles, based on femtosecond laser ablation,
    % nanoparticles were developed: a direct laser-writing technique, allowing for precise patterning of the substrate
    % (coated with a thin film of $\alpha$-Si), but lacking good control of nanoparticle size and a less precise technique
    % of forward laser transfer of nanoparticle to an arbitrary substrate, with very good control of particle diameter in the
    % range of $100-200$nm.

        The results of the project were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nanoscale~--- ``Laser fabrication of
    crystalline silicon nanoresonators from an amorphous film for low-loss all-dielectric nanophotonics''\cite{dmitriev2016laser} and
    ``Resonant Raman scattering from silicon nanoparticles enhanced by magnetic response''\cite{dmitriev2016resonant}.
