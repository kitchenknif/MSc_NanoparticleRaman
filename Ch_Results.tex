\section{Results}
    The main results of the project are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A single-stage technique of fabricating crystalline nanoparticles out of amorphous
            semiconductor thin-films, using femtosecond laser ablation was developed. The method
            has control over the size of the fabricated particles and transfers the nanoparticles
            to arbitrary substrates.
        \item X-Ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy were used to demonstrate that the
            fabricated nanoparticles are in fact crystalline.
        \item Dark-field spectroscopy was used to demonstrate that the nanoparticles have
            ``Mie''-type optical resonances.
        \item Single nanoparticle Raman spectroscopy was used to demonstrate resonant enhancement of Raman scattering
            from the nanoparticles on their magnetic dipole resonances.
        \item The results of the fabrication section of this project were published in the peer-review
            journal Nanoscale~--- ``Laser fabrication of
            crystalline silicon nanoresonators from an amorphous film for low-loss all-dielectric nanophotonics''\cite{dmitriev2016laser}.
        \item The results of the Raman enhancement section of this project were published in the peer-review
            journal Nanoscale~--- ``Resonant Raman scattering from silicon nanoparticles
            enhanced by magnetic response''\cite{dmitriev2016resonant}.
    \end{enumerate}
