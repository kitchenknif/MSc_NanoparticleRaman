\section*{Acknowledgements}

        I would like to thank D. Baranov for developing the theoretical description of the processes studied in this project.

        I would like to thank V. Milichko and my supervisor, A. Samusev, for helping with designing, optimizing and carrying the experimental work:
    Dark-field spectroscopy and Raman scattering.

        I would like to thank I. Mukhin for carrying out SEM experiments needed for this project.

        I would like to thank A. Sitnikova for carrying out TEM and X-Ray diffractometry experiments needed for this project.

        I would also like to S. Makarov for the huge amount of assistance he provided throughout the whole project~--- help with
    designing and building and optimizing the fabrication setup, assitance with numerical simulations and detailed discussions about the
    physics of the underlying processes in the fabrication techniques.
