    \subsection{Fabrication of Crystalline Silicon Nanoparticles by Femtosecond Laser Ablation}
    \label{sec:Ablation}
            The first part of the project was to develop a new, simple, method of fabricating crystalline dielectric
        nanoparticles. The idea was to use controlled laser ablation~--- a very simple technique~--- to produce the particles.
        Previous work on the topic~\cite{kuznetsov2012magnetic, zywietz2014laser} has shown that it is possible to fabricate single particles
        of a certain size.

            We ended up developing two different methods to fabricate crystalline nanoparticles~--- direct laser writing of crystalline
        nanoparticles out of a thin film of amorphous silicon (adapted from a method used for plasmonic nanoparticles~\cite{makarov2016controllable},~\citeA{dmitriev2016direct}), and a forward transfer of nanoparticles by single femtosecond laser pulses
        from a transparent substrate with a a thin film of amorphous silicon to an arbitrary acceptor substrate. The second method is
        similar to the the one presented in Ref.~\cite{zywietz2014laser}, but does not require any additional annealing steps to achieve
        nanoparticle crystallinity and is not limited to transparent acceptor substrates.

            The femtosecond laser system used for this project, Femtosecond Oscillator TiF-100F by Avesta Project, is a Ti:Sapphire laser pumped
        by a Nd:YLF frequency doubled laser, emitting laser pulses at a central wavelength of $800~\si{nm}$, with pulse duration of $100~\si{fs}$,
        and repetition frequency of $80~\si{MHz}$.

                            thin films.}
                \label{fig:LaserPrinting}
        \end{figure}

        \subsubsection{Laser Writing of Dielectric Particles}
        \label{met:writing}
                Laser writing of crystalline silicon nanoparticles was done directly in an initially amorphous thin film of a-Si:H.
            The film was patterned by a train of femtosecond pulses~--- by ablating the directly irradiated material, one can cut patches
            out of the a-Si film~\cite{makarov2016controllable},~\citeA{dmitriev2016direct}. The area irradiated by a single laser pulse
            with a fluence of $F\approx100~\si{mJ/cm^{2}}$ is brought close to the melting point of silicon, while using a pulse train with
            a delay of $12.5~\si{ns}$ between the pulses causes heat accumulation in the film, reaching and exceeding the ablation threshold.
                Heat is also transferred to the non-irradiated areas of the film, and tends to accumulate in the cut-out patches, because they
            are thermally isolated from the rest of the film, and the thermal conductivity of the substrate is much lower than the thermal
            conductivity of the film. Theses patches become unstable at high temperatures and can dewet to form a number of nanoparticles~\cite{thompson2012solid}.
            The size and number of the resulting nanoparticles can be controlled by laser fluence and repetition rate, cut patch size, and
            initial film thickness.

        \subsubsection{Laser Transfer of Crystalline Dielectric Particles}
        \label{met:transfer}

                Laser transfer of the nanoparticles was carried out using single femtosecond laser pulses. The particles were fabricated from
            a thin, amorphous, a-Si:H film in a forward transfer geometry (the relieving substrate is below the donor substrate and film, with a
            spacing of around $\sim 50~\si{\upmu m}$~--- see Fig.~\ref{fig:LaserPrinting}(a)). All of the particles were fabricated from
            previously undamaged areas of the silicon thin film. A forward-transfer geometry has an advantage over the back-transfer geometry
            that was presented in Ref.~\cite{zywietz2014laser}~--- it does not force the substrate to be transparent, allowing particles to be
            transferred to a wide variety of substrates, including structured, opaque samples.

                The single laser pulses required for the technique were selected from a train of femtosecond laser pulses by a Pockels cell
            pulse picker from Avesta Project. The pulses were focused by an $100\times$ Olympus oil immersion microscope objective with a
            numerical aperture of $\mathit{NA}=1.4$. Using the Rayleigh criterion, $\emph{d}\approx 1.22\lambda/\mathit{NA}$ the beam's focal
            spot size can be estimated to be $d=0.7~\si{\upmu m}$, which is closes to the value estimated by a method using the dependence
            of the area damaged by the laser on the laser energy ($0.68~\si{\upmu m}$)~~\cite{liu1982simple}.

                The film used for the fabrication process was an $80~\si{nm}$ thick a-Si:H film deposited on afused silica substrate by
            plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) from a SiH$_{3}$ precursor gas. Laser energies in the range of $0.5-1.2~\si{nJ}$, were used in the fabrication process, providing fluencies in
            the range of $0.12-0.16~\si{J/cm^{2}}$. The fabricated nanoparticles were to close being spherical in shape(figure~\ref{fig:Crystallinity}(b))
            and with diameters in the range of $50-200~\si{nm}$, depending on the fluence.

    \subsection{Optical Measurements}
            All of the optical characterization measurements were carried out on a multifunctional setup, depicted in
            Fig.~\ref{fig:expSetup}. The setup allowed us to measure optical signals from single nanoparticles, provided that
            there was at least $1\mu$ m between the nanoparticle and its nearest neighbors. The XYZ-stage used for the
            positioning of the particles had $100$nm precision, giving enough control to position a single nanoparticle into
            the center of the excitation beam.

            The scattered light was collected from the top by an objective (Mitutoyo M Plan APO NIR, 100x, NA=0.7),
            sent to a Horiba LabRam HR spectrometer and projected onto a thermoelectrically cooled charge-coupled device
            (CCD, Andor DU 420A--OE 325) with a 150-g/mm diffraction grating. The spectrometer gave us a spectral resolution
            of around $1$nm.

        \subsubsection{Polarization-Resolved Dark-field Spectroscopy of Single Nanoparticles}
            \label{sec:Darkfield}
                For the dark-field scattering experiments, the nanoparticles were excited at an oblique angle of incidence
            (65 degrees to the surface normal) by linearly polarized light from a halogen lamp (HL--2000--FHSA)
            through a weakly-focusing objective (Mitutoyo M Plan Apo NIR, 10x, NA=0.28). The polarization allowed us to
            selectively excite different modes in the nanoparticles~\cite{permyakov2015probing}, see Fig. \ref{fig:PolarizedDF}.

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
                    \begin{center}
                        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs/methods/DF/id_52780.eps}
                    \end{center}
                    \caption{Different Mie-type resonances excited by different polarizations of incident light.}
                    \label{fig:PolarizedDF}
            \end{figure}

        \subsubsection{Raman Spectroscopy of Single Nanoparticles}
        \label{sec:Raman}
                For the Raman scattering experiments, the nanoparticles were excited by one of two laser sources: a $632.8$nm HeNe laser
            or a $532$nm Nd:YAG laser, through the same channel that was used to collect the scattered light. A lowpass filter was used
            to filter out the excitation wavelength and leave only the Stokes-shifted inelastically scattered light.

                Raman intensity is proportional to the volume of the Raman-active material. One of the goals of the project was to compare
            the intensity of Raman scattering by particles with different resonance positions, which meant comparing particles of different
            sizes. This meant that for any meaningful comparison, the Raman signal had to be normalized to the volume of the particles, allowing
            comparisons of intensity per volume to be made.

    \subsection{Analytical Model of Raman Signal Enhancement by Mie resonances of Nanoparticles}
        \label{sec:Theory}
            This derivation is taken from the derivation in Ref.~\citeA{dmitriev2016resonant}.

            To describe the enhancement of Raman scattering and analyze the role of the electric and magnetic
        Mie resonances of a silicon nanoparticle, the rigorous Green tensor approach was employed. Ideologically,
        the theoretical approach is based on earlier related studies~~\cite{canccado2014theory, murphy1983enhanced}.

        In this framework, first, the spatial field distribution $\mathbf{E}_{exc}(\mathbf{r})$
        inside the nanoparticle at the excitation frequency created by an external source was determined. Assuming that a
        spherical nanoparticle in free space is illuminated by a plane wave, the normalized
        electric field inside the nanoparticle can be represented as a series of vector spherical harmonics~~\cite{bohren1983absorption}:
        %
        \begin{align}
            \mathbf{E}_{exc}(\mathbf{r})=\sum\nolimits_{n=1}^\infty E_n \left(c_n\mathbf{M}_{o1n}^{(1)}(\mathbf{r}) -
            i{d_n}\mathbf{N}_{e1n}^{(1)}(\mathbf{r})\right) ,
            \label{eq1}
        \end{align}
        %
        where $c_n$ and $d_n$ are the Mie coefficients, ${{\mathbf{M}}_{o1n}^{(1)}}$ and ${{\mathbf{N}}_{e1n}^{(1)}}$ are
        the orthogonal vectorial spherical harmonics, and ${E_n} = {i^n}(2n + 1)/[n(n + 1)]$. The excitation field distribution
        at each point inside the medium defines the Raman polarization oscillating at the Stokes frequency $\omega_S$ according to
        %
        \begin{align}
            {{\bf{P}}_s}\left( {\bf{r}} \right) = {\chi _s}\hat \alpha_j \left( {\bf{r}} \right){{\bf{E}}_{exc}}\left( {\bf{r}} \right),
            \label{eq2}
        \end{align}
        %
        where $\chi_s$ is the scalar Raman susceptibility, and $\hat \alpha_j$ is the Raman polarizability tensor representing
        the threefold degenerate transverse optical (TO) phonon mode excitation~~\cite{ralston1970spontaneous, peter2010fundamentals}.
        Induced Raman polarization, in turn, produces an electromagnetic field at the observation point
        $\mathbf{r}_0$ given by $\mathbf{E}_s(\mathbf{r}_0) = (\omega_s^2/c^2)\int\limits_V {{{\hat G}_s}\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_0},{\mathbf{r}}} \right){{\mathbf{P}}_s}\left( {\mathbf{r}} \right){d^3}{\mathbf{r}}}$,
        where  ${\hat G_s}\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_0},{\mathbf{r}}} \right)$ is the Green tensor at the Stokes frequency accounting
        for the Si nanoparticle and integration is carried out over the nanoparticle volume $V$. Finally, the collected signal at
        the point $\mathbf{r}_0$ is presented in the form:
        %
        \begin{align} %Final collected signal
            S\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_0}} \right)
                =  \sum\limits_j {\left \langle{{\mathbf{E}}_s^*\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_0}} \right){{\mathbf{E}}_s}\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_0}} \right)} \right\rangle}
                = \sum\limits_j {\frac{{\omega _s^4}}{{{c^4}}}\iint\limits_V {{d^3}{{\mathbf{r}}_1}{d^3}{{\mathbf{r}}_2}\left\langle {\hat G_s^*\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_0},{{\mathbf{r}}_1}} \right){\mathbf{P}}_s^*\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_1}} \right){{\hat G}_s}\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_0},{{\mathbf{r}}_2}} \right){{\mathbf{P}}_s}\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_2}} \right)} \right\rangle }}  \\
                = \sum\limits_j {\frac{{\omega _s^4}}{{{c^4}}}\iint\limits_V {{d^3}{{\mathbf{r}}_1}{d^3}{{\mathbf{r}}_2}\hat G_s^*\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_0},{{\mathbf{r}}_1}} \right){\mathbf{E}}_{exc}^*\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_1}} \right){{\hat G}_s}\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_0},{{\mathbf{r}}_2}} \right){{\mathbf{E}}_{exc}}\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_2}} \right)\chi _s^2\left\langle {\hat \alpha _j^*\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_1}} \right) \otimes {{\hat \alpha }_j}\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_2}} \right)} \right\rangle }},
            \label{eq4}
        \end{align}
        %
        where summation is performed over the three degenerate TO phonon modes. Since the Raman scattering is a spontaneous process
        (until we enter the stimulated Raman scattering regime), the  induced polarization $\mathbf{P}_s$ is not coherent across
        the whole particle. Therefore, in Eq.~(\ref{eq4}), the averaging is carried out over all possible realizations of the Raman
        polarization $\mathbf{P}_s$. Taking into account that the correlation length of the Raman scattering in silicon $L_c$ is of
        the order of tens nanometer and much less than the nanoparticle diameter, the correlation of the Raman
        polarizability tensors can be approximated by the Dirac delta function
        $\left\langle {\hat \alpha_j \left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_1}} \right) \otimes \hat \alpha_j \left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_2}} \right)} \right\rangle \sim \delta \left({{\mathbf{r}_1} - {\mathbf{r}_2}} \right)$.
        Under this assumption, Eq.~(\ref{eq4}) reduces to
        %
        \begin{align}
            S\left( {{{\bf{r}}_0}} \right) = \frac{{\omega _s^4}}{{{c^4}}}\sum\limits_j {\int\limits_V {{d^3}{\bf{r}}{{\left| {{{\hat G}_s}\left(
            {{{\bf{r}}_0},{\bf{r}}} \right){{\hat \alpha }_j}{\chi _s}{{\bf{E}}_{exc}}\left( {\bf{r}} \right)} \right|}^2}} }
            \label{eq5}
        \end{align}
        %
        \begin{figure}[h!]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/intro/TheoryEnhancement.eps}
            \end{center}
            \caption{Log plot of normalized intensity of Raman scattering as a function of dimensionless nanoparticle diameter for the magnetic dipole (MD),
            electric dipole (ED), magnetic quadrupole (MQ) and electric quadrupole (EQ) resonances.}
            \label{fig:TheoryEnhancement}
        \end{figure}

            Expression~(\ref{eq5}) can be simplified with the use of the single-mode approximation. The
        electromagnetic response of an optically small Si nanoparticle at the excitation wavelength is dominated by a single
        magnetic or electric multipole resonance depending on the particle radius~~\cite{evlyukhin2010optical}. Therefore,
        only one resonant term in Eq.~(\ref{eq1}) is required and the electric field inside the nanoparticle can be represented as ${
        {\mathbf{{E}}}_{exc}} \approx {E_n}{c_n}{\mathbf{M}}_{o1n}^{(1)}$, for the $n-$th magnetic resonance, and
        ${{\mathbf{{E}}}_{exc}}\approx -i{E_n}{d_n}{\mathbf{N}}_{e1n}^{(1)}$, for the $n-$th electric resonance.
        Furthermore, since the Raman shift in silicon is small compared to the linewidth $\gamma$ of
        Mie resonance at $\omega_0$, the main contribution to the Green tensor is provided by the same eigenmode of
        the system. Therefore, expanding the Green tensor in the series of eigenmodes~~\cite{ishimaru1991electromagnetic} and keeping only
        the resonant term:
        %
        \begin{align}
            {\hat G_s}\left( {{{\bf{r}}_0},{\bf{r}}} \right) \approx \frac{{{c^2}}}{{{N^2}}}\frac{{{\bf{u}}\left( {{{\bf{r}}_0}} \right) \otimes
            {\bf{u}}^*\left( {\bf{r}} \right)}}{{{{\left( {{\omega _0} + i\gamma } \right)}^2} - \omega _s^2}},
            \label{eq8}
        \end{align}
        %
        where ${{\mathbf{u}}\left( {{\mathbf r}} \right)}$ is the spatial field distribution of the eigenmode, and
        ${N^2} = {\int {{\mathop{\rm Re}\nolimits} \varepsilon \left( {\bf{r}} \right)\left| {{\bf{u}}\left( {\bf{r}} \right)} \right|} ^2}{d^3}{\bf{r}}$
        is the normalization constant. Finally, integrating the expression (5) over the whole volume $V$ of the nanoparticle,
        the following simple expression, describing the Raman signal enhanced by a single Mie resonance, can be written:
        %
        \begin{align}
            S\left( {{{\mathbf{r}}_0}} \right) \approx V{\left( {\frac{{{\omega _s}}}{c}} \right)^4}{\left| {\frac{{{\chi_s s_n}}}{{{{\left( {{\omega
            _0} + i\gamma } \right)}^2} - \omega _s^2}}} \right|^2},
            \label{eq9}
        \end{align}
        %
        where $s_n$ stands for the Mie coefficient, either $c_n$ or $d_n$ of the corresponding mode. The above expression clearly
        shows that the total enhancement of Raman scattering depends on two factors: the enhancement of the excitation field
        inside the medium, and the Purcell enhancement of the Raman dipoles radiation~~\cite{checoury2010deterministic}.

        The two key parameters entering Eq.~(\ref{eq9}) are the resonance frequency $\omega_0$ and the resonance linewidth $\gamma$.
        The resonance frequency can be easily estimated numerically, while for the estimation of the resonance linewidth one can
        employ analytical expressions from Ref.~\cite{lai1991effect}. Substituting these values into Eq.~(\ref{eq9}), one can obtain the desired
        spectrum of Raman scattering enhanced by the resonances of a silicon sphere. This spectrum (normalized by the particle
        volume $V=4\pi R^3/3$) is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:TheoryEnhancement} as a  function of dimensionless nanoparticle diameter $D/\lambda_{\rm Si}$
        with $\lambda_{\rm Si}=163$~nm being the wavelength of the excitation signal inside the silicon for the magnetic dipole (MD), electric dipole (ED),
        magnetic quadrupole (MQ) and electric quadrupole (EQ) resonances assuming a constant excitation wavelength of 633~nm,
        used below in experiments.

        The derived single-mode expression (\ref{eq9}) makes it possible to clearly separate contributions of each Mie resonance of the
        nanoparticle into the total Raman scattering enhancement. As follows from Fig.~(\ref{fig:TheoryEnhancement}), the strongest enhancement
        is associated with the MQ resonance due to its high $Q-$factor. Notably, the predicted Raman scattering enhancement
        at the MD resonance, which occurs for the smallest particles, is more than an order of magnitude larger than that for
        the ED resonance.


    \subsubsection{Numerical Methods}
    \label{sec:Numeric}
        Several numerical methods were used to simulate the scattering properties of the fabricated nanoparticles~--- to prove their
        crystalline phase, to probe their shape, to determine their size. The initial idea was to use the Discrete Dipole Approximation,
        because it is very flexible and can work with scatterers of arbitrary geometry. The main problem that was encountered was the fact
        the method is very involved (especially if one tries to incorporate substrate interaction), and computationally intensive for
        the required problems. Many calculations turned out to be excessive~-- a simple Mie theory calculation,
        while simulating a slightly different geometry, was more than enough to model the required parameters, with error well within the
        requirements.

        For calculations of field distribution inside the nanoparticles presented in this thesis, CST Microwave Studio was used.
        It is an  EM simulation package that uses the Finite Integration Technique for most of its calculations.

        \subsubsection{Discrete Dipole Approximation}
        \label{subsec:DDA}

                For the DDA calculations, a custom, Python-based implementation was written, PyDDA~--- a reimplementation of an existing
            Matlab toolkit, DDA-SI~\cite{loke2011discrete}. The implementation even included surface-interaction components in its' calculations,
            but the complexity of the calculation and difficulty of accurately modeling particles led to the DDA being abandoned in favor of plain
            Mie theory, which provided more than enough accuracy for the purposes of the project.

        \label{subsec:FIT}

                CST Microwave studio was used to model field distribution inside and around the silicon nanoparticles, to
            demonstrate the electric field confinement at different types of resonances (electric and magnetic dipole resonances).
            The model was a slightly oblate spheroid, corresponding to the experimentally determined geometric parameters of the
            nanoparticles.
